# Sleep Companion

This App and companion arduino code is created for a project for COMP 3800 Mobile Health at 
Wentworth Institute of Technology taught by Professor Jones Yu. The intended purpose of this app is
 to monitor and improve the user's sleep by collecting data about their sleep and using that data to
  create insights on steps to improve the quality of sleep and the difficulty of waking up.
